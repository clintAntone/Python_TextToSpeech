Programmers are notoriously famous for being quiet and difficult to talk to. They’re usually hard at work, staring blankly at their laptop screens for hours (sometimes more) trying to solve problems in their applications and trying to give their users a great experience. This dedication to giving users a perfect experience may sometimes cause them to overdose on coffee and pizza, keeping the bugs out of the user’s way is not an easy task.
